Spicy and refreshing, the bright-tasting broth is a mix of sweet, salty, sour and herbaceous. You may substitute mussels or prawns for the clams."),

Tom refers to the boiling process, while yam refers to a Thai spicy and sour salad. Indeed, tom yum is characterised by its distinct hot and sour flavours, with fragrant spices and herbs generously used in the broth. The basic broth is made of stock and fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed chili peppers."),

Not only are they great for a weekly night dinner, but they are also special enough for a dinner party menu! The health benefits of salmon cannot be overstated. It's an excellent source of Omega-3 fatty acids, and baking does not decrease that content. In case you were wondering, salmon is also rich in B12, vitamin D, and selenium, and is low in mercury."),

The tasty, buttery crumb topping gives the halibut nice flavor and texture, and it bakes in just minutes.Choose Pacific or Alaskan halibut fillets or steaks for this recipe.
